## Power Allocation System API
### Overview
This project is a power allocation system that manages a limited power supply of 100 units with a safety threshold of 92 units. It uses a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) approach to allocate power among multiple connected devices, ensuring fair distribution and safety constraints.
